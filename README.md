# Simple-JSON-Formatter
This is a very simple python script that will nicely format a JSON file. Feel free to fork or add issues.

Usage:

> python json_formatter.py foo.json bar.json

This will read the file foo.json and output it pretty printed to bar.json

Or you can just dump the out put to the terminal by leaving off the second argument

> python json_formatter.py foo.json
